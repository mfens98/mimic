you need to do is copy and paste them in and edit the appropriate places.

Server_building:

{"metadata" : {"server_building" : "time_in_seconds"}}  #Note: Don't forget to either set mimic to run in real time with the -r flag or tick the clock forward yourself

Error on server(VM) boot:

{"metadata" : {"create_server_failure" : "{\"message\" : \"Insert message here\" , \"code\" : code_value}"}} 

Commonly used messages are:
  
  - "Not enough resources (cores, instances, etc)" Code: 403
    - Sample message: "Quota exceeded for cores: Requested 16, but already used 40 of 40 cores (HTTP 403)"
  - "Internal server error" Code: 500
